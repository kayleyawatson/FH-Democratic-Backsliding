# A Longitudinal Study of Global Democratic Backsliding

The project is a longitudinal analysis aimed at understanding the trends and patterns of democratic decline worldwide. By examining data spanning an 18-year period, this study seeks to identify key factors contributing to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions across different regions.

Democratic backsliding, characterized by the weakening of democratic institutions, erosion of civil liberties, and the rise of authoritarian tendencies, poses a significant challenge to global stability and governance. This project aims to shed light on the dynamics of democratic backsliding by analyzing historical data and identifying potential drivers behind this phenomenon.
